# UniFi Poller: `webserver` plugin

Moved to https://github.com/unpoller/unpoller/tree/master/pkg/webserver

Built-In Web Server Go Library for UniFi Poller.

Enabling the web server is optional. It provides a window into the running data.
The web server may be secured with a simple password. SSL is also optional.

See the [Web Server Wiki](https://github.com/unifi-poller/unifi-poller/wiki/Web-Server)
for more information about how it works.

Other plugins must import this library to make use of it. While this library is
labeled as a plugin, it's pretty much required since everything imports it.
That said, it is still disabled by default, and won't store any data unless it's
enabled.

_This needs a better godoc and examples._
